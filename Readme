Program:
	DCC-Decode

Description:
	An embedded program running on a PIC24 microprocessor to extract and execute
	commands from a model railroad command station. This program implements an
	accessory decoder but the code should enable, with significant alterations,
	the creation of a multi-function decoder.

	The communications protocol is defined by the National Model Railroad Association
	(NMRA) and is documented on their web site in their NMRA Standards 'S 9.1',
	S-9.1.2, S 9.2, S-9.2.1, S-9.2.2, S-9.2.3 and S-9.2.4
